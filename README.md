# "Tadaima" - I'm home!

Re-Invent home server software, Inspired from enterprise close source code management software I use at work.

#TODO:

- Make java frontend
- Mock up basic python scripts for niche functions that is too much effort to do in java
- Work on java-python integration for callbacks
- Sockets and socks
- *Achieve goals in WIP*

# WIP features
- Grab a generic website, find and download all the relevant media specified by user
- Create and manage todo tickets for the home
- Spotify home node integration (fake device) 
- Chromecast media sharing from server node
- Integrate with raid/samba volumes hosted on another machine
- 3rd party data share backup integration
- Interfacing with ip cams
- Control and manage produciton server (view jobs, terminate/run them and also view cron)
- Interface with my GOES satellite reciver (raspi and antenna that sit on the roof awaiting for a GOES or NOAA satellite to fly by and capture RF weather data beamed back, useful for when WW3 happens and there is no more internet (lol).
